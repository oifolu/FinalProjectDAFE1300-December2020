          Our Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p>
          When a person is sentenced to prison, you can look at it
          as he owes society a portion of his time. However, todays
          prison industry is poorly suited to make sure that the
          time someone spends in jail is actually invested in a
          manner that is beneficial to the society in general.
