        <p>
          When a person is sentenced to prison, you can look at it
          as he owes society a portion of his time. However, todays
          prison industry is poorly suited to make sure that the
          time someone spends in jail is actually invested in a
          manner that is beneficial to the society in general.

          Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p>
          We try to help countries rethink their approach to how
          punishment for non violent offences should be completed.
          By imagining the time each person owes as an asset that
          can be reinvested into the local-, regional, or even
          international environment - we have identified a number
          of ways in which the conventional system of sentencing
          can be repurposed to make sure that time doe not go to
          waste but rather will benefit us all.
