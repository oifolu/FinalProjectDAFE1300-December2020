          The Challenge
        </h1><br>
        <h2>
          It is way past time to reinvent our approach to
          sentencing of non-violent offenders.
        </h2><br>
        <h4>
          A prisoner who is able to do something truly meaningful
          with their sentence will most likely get a sense of
          satisfaction, and gratitude towards the society in
          general, that an ordinary prison sentence usually will
          not provide.<br>
          <br>
          We aim to help countries rethink their approach to how
          punishment for non violent offences should be
          completed.<br>
          Our planet is in dire need of all available resources to
          aid its deteriorating plant- and animal life.<br>
          <br>
          We believe prisoners who pose absolutely no threat to
          their surroundings - and who are willing and able -
          should be given the opportunity to carry out their
          sentence by participating in important and meaningful
          tasks that help protect the environment.

        <h1>
          The Approach
        </h1><br>
        <h2>
          While our planet is suffering by our hand - our inmates
          are forced into an empty meaningless existence.
        </h2><br>
        <h4>
          If we dare to think outside of the box we can tackle two
          challenges simultaneously.<br>
          <br>
          By imagining the time each convict has to serve as an
          <i>asset</i> that can be reinvested into the local-,
          regional, or even international environment - we have
          identified a number of ways in which the conventional
          system of sentencing can be repurposed.<br>
          This enables us to make sure that time doe not go to
          waste but rather will <i>benefit</i> us all.<br>
          <br>
          Our mission lies in challenging authorities world over to
          giving prisoners an opportunity to invest the time they
          are sentenced.<br>
          This "investment" can be contributing to something
          meaningful and beneficial, we believe there is a wealth
          of gains to be made for all involved parties.<br>

        <h1>
          The Benefits
        </h1><br>
        <h2>
          There is an obvious benefit in getting as many people
          around the world to help take care of our wildlife.
        </h2><br>
        <h4>
          <br>
          If we could access the so far <i>untapped</i> resource
          that many of the worlds prison inmates can contribute
          with, it would provide an enormous amount of assistance
          to all living beings.<br>
          Taking better care for the environment means taking
          better care of the worlds population as well.<br>
          <br>
          We are facing rising challenges with food shortages and
          hunger, but we have the opportunity and means to combat
          these threats.<br>
          Beyond providing much needed aid to our plants and
          animals, the prisoners themselves would benefit.<br>
          <br>
          By obtaining new skillsets and hopefully even finding a
          direction or purpose in life that has been missing - this
          will have major benefits when it comes to actually
          rehabilitation.<br>
          <br>
          It is a widely accepted fallacy that imprisonment of all
          types of criminals serves the common good.<br>
          Rehabilitation - which is the stated goal for the prison
          systems we know today - is not nurtured and encouraged in
          the way it should.
