Idea:

I will work on developing an idea I came up with for the Innovation Methods assignment as a Solution to achieve food security and improved nutrition and sustainable agriculture.

My solution is not a technical one, it is an approach that requires society dare take a look at current structures in society and how they can be re-organised in order for us to all work together with the goal of improving life on this planet.

In the Innovation Methods Assignment I came up with a solution that went as following:

"Sentence non-violent offenders to serve their time working on re-forestation projects as an alternative to wasting their time in prison."

I want to imagine this solution in the form of an organization actively working to achieve this goal in countries all over the world.
And as such the main purpose of the website is not to present a brilliant, and perhaps hard-to-explain, technical solution to the average person.

The goal I want to achieve when visitors access this website is that they get this idea presented in a well thought out and precisely worded manner which explains in as simple terms as possible what the obvious benefits of this approach will be. I aim to make the site as light on text as possible, but I realise that this might be a hard challenge as I am selling a "philosphy" more than a product and in this regard the visitor might a thorough explanation of what inspired this idea and why adopting it might be an essential step towards achieving this UN Sustainable Development Goals.


Concept:

When a person is sentenced to prison, you can look at it as he owes society a portion of his time. However, todays prison system (or industry) is poorly suited to make sure that the time someone spends in jail is actually invested in a manner that is beneficial to the society in general.

Just keeping someone locked in a cell does the population of a nation no real service, unless that person poses an actual threat to their surroundings.

However, in many cases we know that offenders that have no violent history, and is sentenced to prison for a non-violent offence, will spend the entirety of their sentence behind prison walls - when there is an entire planet outside these walls in desperate need of someone able to dedicate a significant portion of their time to aid the environment and help fortify it against threats like climate change, pollution, erotion, deforestation and so on.

IQtm - Intelligent Time Management.

We try to help countries rethink their approach to how punishment for non violent offences should be completed.
By imagining the time each person owes as an asset that can be reinvested into the local-, regional, or even international environment - we have identified a number of ways in which the conventional system of sentencing can be repurposed to make sure that time doe not go to waste but rather will benefit us all.

By challenging authorities world over to giving prisoners an opportunity to invest the time they are sentenced to into contributing to something meaningful and beneficial, we believe there is a wealth of gains to be made for all involved parties.

The prisoner who is able to do something truly meaningful with his or her sentence will most likely get a sense of satisfaction, and gratitude towards the society in general, that an ordinary prison sentence usually will not provide. Beyond that, the prisoners might even be able to obtain a new skillset or find a direction or purpose in life that has been missing and this - we imagine - will have major benefits when it comes to actually rehabilitation - which is the stated goal for the prison systems we know today but which most of us know our current system has poor metrics of when it comes to actually proving its ability to provide.
